wuhcag_detail: |
  <p>To make websites as safe as possible for all users, you must limit the amount of flashing media. Flashing content can harm the health of some users.</p>
wuhcag_tips: |
  <ul>
   <li>This builds on Guideline 2.3.1 by removing an exception that I recommend you ignore anyway.</li>
   <li>Remember, flashing is different to blinking (see Guideline 2.2.2).</li>
  </ul>
