wuhcag_summary: "No content flashes more than three times per second"
wuhcag_detail: |
  <p>To make your website as safe as possible for all users, you must limit the amount of flashing media. Flashing content can harm the health of some users.</p>
wuhcag_tips: |
  <p>Remember, flashing is different to blinking (see Guideline 2.2.2).</p>
wuhcag_what_to_do: |
  <p>Don't add anything to your website that flashes more than three times per second.</p>
wuchcag_exceptions: |
  <p>There is a ridiculously complicated exception based on the userâ€™s visual field. You should just avoid all flashing content, but here it is:</p>
  <blockquote>the combined area of flashes occurring concurrently occupies no more than a total of .006 steradians within any 10 degree visual field on the screen (25% of any 10 degree visual field on the screen) at typical viewing distance.<cite><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/seizure-does-not-violate.html">Understanding WCAG 2.0</a></cite></blockquote>
  <p>If you can work out what that means, I dare you to use it.</p>
