    wuhcag_detail: |
      <p>The meaning of content on your website relies on the order you present it. For example, in English we read from left to right and read a left-hand column before a right-hand column. Present the content on your website in an order that your users can understand.</p>
      <p>Some of your users rely on assistive technology (like a screen reader) to interpret content. By sequencing content correctly, you can make sure that your users with disabilities can understand your website and improve your overall web accessibility.</p>
    wuhcag_tips: |
      <p>Invest in some assistive technology and use it to browse your website. <a href="http://www.nvaccess.org/">NVDA is a free screen reader</a> you can try to get started.</p>
      <p>Turn off the site’s Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) and check that your web page displays in the correct order. You can use an extension like <a href="http://www.chromeextensions.org/webmaster-seo/pendule/">Pendule for Chrome</a> to easily toggle CSS on and off.</p>
      <p>Using headings to show importance isn’t always straightforward. Headings on a web page are a great way to break up content and show your users the relative importance of each section. Headings in HTML range from 1 (the most important) to 6 (the least important). It’s best to have just one Heading1 (H1) on a web page, to show the title of that page.</p>
      <p>However, headings don’t need to descend from 1 to 6 each time you use one. As well as headings that share levels, you can skip levels altogether if that fits your content.</p>
    wuhcag_what_to_do: |
      <p>Ensuring you present your content in a meaningful sequence is a wide-ranging part of web accessibility. It applies to all elements of all pages, so is as big or as small a task as your website.</p>
      <p>Make sure you:</p>
      <ul>
       <li>Present content in a meaningful order.</li>
       <li>Separate navigation menus from content.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Always present your content so that it preserves your meaning. That way, it’s great for anyone reading it. The main things to look out for are:</p>
      <ul>
       <li>Use paragraphs in order.</li>
       <li>Use headings to show importance.</li>
       <li>Choose whether a list needs numbering or not.</li>
       <li>Use valid HTML and check it with the W3C’s markup validator.15</li>
      </ul>
