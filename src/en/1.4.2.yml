wuhcag_summary: "Don’t play audio automatically"
wuhcag_detail: |
  <p>Automatically playing sounds doesn't help your users. Your users don't need audio distractions when visiting your website. You have a hard enough time getting them to do what you want. Some of your users will have problems focusing and unexpected sounds can distract them further.</p>
wuhcag_tips: |
wuhcag_what_to_do: |
  <ul>
    <li>Don’t have any audio that plays automatically.</li>
    <li>Have all the audio you want, just let your users choose when they want to hear it.</li>
  </ul>
wuchcag_exceptions: |
  <p>Although you can pass this guideline by adding a pause, mute or stop function to automatic audio, that’s a bad idea. You don't want your users frantically searching around your website for the audio control.</p>
  <p>Users shouldn't have to take action for a better experience, you need to provide it to them by default.</p>
  <p>There’s a further exception on audio that plays for less than three seconds. Ignore this too. Three seconds of audio can still distract users, especially those who have problems maintaining focus.</p>
