    wuhcag_detail: |
      <p>Some of your users with visual impairments will need to resize text in order to understand it fully. You should allow for up to a 200% resize of text without dropping any content or functions.</p>
    wuhcag_tips: |
      <ul>
       <li>Resizing text is different to zooming (which enlarges text, images and layout without preserving formatting).</li>
       <li>Check your website by resizing to 200% in a variety of browsers.</li>
       <li>Make sure your resized text doesn’t require the user to scroll horizontally and you fulfil part of Guideline 1.4.8.</li>
      </ul>
    wuhcag_what_to_do: |
    wuchcag_exceptions: |

       <li>Images of text (but don’t use images of text, because they don’t resize well).</li>
       <li>Captions.</li>
      </ul>
