wuhcag_summary: "Provide a text alternative to your videos"
wuhcag_detail: |
  <p>While you may have produced captions or audio description to enhance your videos, some users will rely on a text alternative to get the information. Providing a full text transcript of a video, including links to any calls to action, can help make it more accessible.</p>
wuhcag_tips: |
  <ul>
   <li>You may have fulfilled this Guideline if you chose to meet Guideline 1.2.3 with a text transcript and then fulfilled Guideline 1.2.5 with audio description.</li>
   <li>A good transcript contains all information in the video, such as visual cues, description and dialogue attribution.</li>
  </ul>
wuhcag_what_to_do: |
  <ul>
   <li>Provide a full text transcript for your video and link to it from near the original content.</li>
   <li>If the video needs audio description, make sure that is also in place.</li>
  </ul>
wuchcag_exceptions: |
  <p>If the video is itself an alternative, you donâ€™t need to add a transcript.</p>
