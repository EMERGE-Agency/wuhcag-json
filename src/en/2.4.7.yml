 wuhcag_detail: |
   <p>Your users need to find their way around your website in a sequential and meaningful order. If they use a keyboard to navigate your website, they should be able to see which element they are on at any time.</p>
   <p>The best way to do this is to style a visible border or outline around the element in use, whether it's a form field, link, menu, content area or any other element. This makes it easier for your users to understand where they are on a page.</p>
 wuhcag_tips: |
  <p>A good <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and CSS website will often already conform to this guideline. Check yours to be sure.</p>
 wuhcag_what_to_do: |
   <ul>
    <li>Make the keyboard focus visible on all elements (menu items, form fields, links, etc…).</li>
    <li>Use <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> to apply a visual aid to keyboard focus – a border and/or underline is best.</li>
   </ul>
