      <p>Some of your users will rely on audio description to help with videos. Adding audio description to your videos means these users have the same information as everyone else.</p>
    wuhcag_tips: |
      <p>If you have provided audio description for videos to meet Guideline 1.2.3, you have already fulfilled this guideline.</p>
      <p>Your audio description version must include everything that might be lost to a visually impaired user – things like:</p>
      <ul>
       <li>Relevant exposition (location, gestures, lighting, colours).</li>
       <li>Identifying new speakers.</li>
       <li>Marking the passing of time.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This is by no means an exhaustive list. The key is to think about what information the video provides and ensure a user with a visual impairment gets the same information.</p>
      <p>Remember to use clear words, use the present tense and keep in sync with the video.</p>
    wuhcag_what_to_do: |
      <p>Make an alternative version of your video with an audio description soundtrack and link to it from near the original content.</p>
    wuchcag_exceptions: |
      <p>You don’t need an audio description if all of the information in the video is provided in the regular soundtrack. Something like a straight face-to-face interview, or a speech to-camera would probably not need audio description.</p>
