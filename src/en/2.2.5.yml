wuhcag_summary: "Save user data when re-authenticating"
wuhcag_detail: |
 <p>It may be essential for your users to re-authenticate their identity for certain functions. For example, you might set a login to expire after a certain amount of time in case a user leaves their computer unattended in the middle of a purchase.</p>
 <p>While your website will rightly use this function for your usersâ€™ security, you can help your users by saving all information entered by the user. When they re-authenticate (such as logging back in) you can display whatever data they had already entered.</p>
wuhcag_tips: |
 <p>If you do ask your users to re-authenticate after a certain amount of time, consider whether your use of a time limit is justified under Guideline 2.2.1 and Guideline 2.2.3.</p>
wuhcag_what_to_do: |
  <ul>
   <li>When you ask a user to re-authenticate their identity, the user can continue exactly as before with saved data (for example, their shopping basket contents, input into forms or accessibility options).</li>
   <li>Things like surveys and questionnaires can be saved and completed at a later date.</li>
  </ul>
