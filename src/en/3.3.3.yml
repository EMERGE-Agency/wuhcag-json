    wuhcag_summary: "Suggest fixes when users make errors"
    wuhcag_detail: |
     <p>All of your users make mistakes – they're only human after all. When they make mistakes on your website (whether it's their fault or not), they get frustrated.</p>
     <p>Fortunately, it's also a great time to demonstrate to your users how much you care about them. Show suggestions and hints when users make mistakes on things like forms and checkouts.</p>
    wuhcag_tips: |
      <ul>
       <li>This guideline builds on Guideline 3.3.1, by adding a requirement to make a suggestion for user input to fix errors.</li>
       <li>Be specific.</li>
       <li>If a user makes an error, provide a list of links that the user can follow to jump back to correct their input.</li>
       <li>Make it easy to re-submit incorrect forms by retaining all correct data.</li>
      </ul>
    wuhcag_what_to_do: |
      <p>To pass this guideline, you need to make sure that:</p>
      <ul>
       <li>Your forms identify input errors.</li>
       <li>When the error is missing a required field, communicate this to the user with a text suggestion.</li>
       <li>If the error is in the format of the input, the suggestion shows the correct format (for example, ‘The date must be in the form DD/MM/YYYY’).</li>
       <li>If the error is because the input needed to be from a limited list of values, provide these values and explain them.</li>
      </ul>
    wuchcag_exceptions: |
      <p>You don't need to provide suggestions if:</p>
      <ul>
       <li>Making a suggestion would negatively impact data security.</li>
       <li>Making a suggestion goes against the purpose of the field.</li>
      </ul>
