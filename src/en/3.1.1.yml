 wuhcag_detail: |
   <p>Setting every webpage's <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> language is an easy way to help your users, including those browsing your website with assistive technology. Setting a language is important because the way that screen readers pronounce words depends on the HTML language assigned to your website.</p>
 wuhcag_tips: |
   <ul>
    <li>Set the language in your template and youâ€™ll only need to do this once.</li>
    <li>If you trade internationally and have different parts of your website in different languages, make sure they are assigned correctly.</li>
    <li>HTML language codes match the <abbr title="International Organisation for Standardisation">ISO</abbr> language codes standard. W3Schools has a <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_language_codes.asp">full list of language codes</a>.</li>
   </ul>
 wuhcag_what_to_do: |
   <p>Ensure that each page of your website has a language assigned to it.</p>
