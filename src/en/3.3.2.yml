wuhcag_detail: |
  <p>Chances are your website will have a feature that requires your users to fill in some information. This might be on a checkout page to buy a product, a contact form to get in touch or a newsletter sign-up to opt in to your mailing list. You need to ensure your users know what’s required of them when they reach one of these elements on your website.</p>
  <p>Without clear labels and instructions, your users won't know what to do.</p>
wuhcag_tips: |
  <ul>
   <li>Instructions need to take into account how they use sensory characteristics.</li>
   <li>Think about how your use of colour affects things like required fields if you want to highlight them by colour. Don’t highlight by colour alone, pick a symbol too.</li>
   <li>Consider error identification as well, and make sure that you give helpful instructions when your users make mistakes on forms.</li>
  </ul>
wuhcag_what_to_do: |
  <ul>
   <li>Label all input fields clearly and helpfully.</li>
   <li>Where a field needs a specific format, give an example (For example, for a ‘date’ field in a form you might use ‘Enter the date as dd/mm/yyyy’)</li>
   <li>Mark required fields with an icon and explain what the icon means before the form.</li>
   <li>Keep your labels simple – too much explanation can be counter-productive. Things like ‘First name’, ‘Email’ and ‘Your message’ are fine.</li>
   <li>The same goes for instructions, ‘Required fields are in red and have a * symbol’ works great. So does ‘Fill in this form and click ‘Submit’ to get in touch’.</li>
  </ul>
