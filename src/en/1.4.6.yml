    wuhcag_summary: "Contrast ratio between your text and background is at least 7:1"
    wuhcag_detail: |
      <p>All of your users will benefit from a good contrast between the text on your website and the background colour. Some of your users with visual impairments need a stronger contrast than others, so getting your colours right is essential.</p>
      <p>While the minimum contrast for Level AA was 4.5:1, for Level AAA it’s 7:1. This higher level of contrast makes it even easier for everyone to read your content.</p>

      <ul>
       <li>You may have fulfilled this guideline when you complied with Guideline 1.4.3.</li>

       <li>Make sure that any embedded charts or images of charts have the minimum contrast between elements (for example, bars, axes and labels).</li>
       <li>This guideline also applies to images of text (but you shouldn't be using images of text – see Guideline 1.4.5).</li>
      </ul>
