     <p>Parsing is the way software like web browsers and assistive technology read and understand a website. It's important that the different technologies your users use to view your website don’t have trouble parsing your website. Parsing is all about your website's code.</p>
     <p>All your users will benefit from a website built on clean and modern HTML. Your website will work properly in all web browsers and on all kinds of devices, from computers to tablets to smartphones.</p>
     <p>Your users who rely on assistive technology will benefit from a well-made website as the technology often relies on HTML parsing. Bad or broken <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> is more likely to cause parsing problems for assistive technology and so increase the chance of users leaving your website.</p>

    wuhcag_what_to_do: |
     <p>This is a wide-ranging guideline, one that changes with time as standards evolve. Your best protection is hiring a web designer who knows parsing well. Find one through recommendations and ask them about their approach to web standards and accessibility.</p>
     <p>Here are the most common issues to watch out for:</p>
     <ul>
      <li>Ensure HTML elements have complete start ( &lt; > ) and end ( &lt;/ > ) tags where needed.</li>
      <li>Nest all HTML elements correctly (for example, list objects within an ordered or unordered list).</li>
      <li>Use unique Ids.</li>
      <li>Check that HTML elements don’t contain duplicate attributes.</li>
     </ul>
