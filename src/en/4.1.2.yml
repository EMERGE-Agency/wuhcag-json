  <p>Everything that's on your website needs to work to defined standards. Where you're writing code that's not <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, it must conform to HTML-like standards. This means that it will work with various assistive technologies.</p>
  <p>The key things to consider are advertising widgets, forms from third parties, things you’ve coded yourself and anything that you add that you can’t be sure how it was coded.</p>
wuhcag_tips: |
  <ul>
   <li>A good – though not foolproof – way to test your website is a HTML validator tool. A validator gives you an idea of how well technology can parse your website. Use it to create a list of priorities.</li>
   <li>The majority of your potential issues will come from third-party code. </li>
   <li>Speak to the developers of any plugins you use and make sure that they’re writing good code.</li>
   <li>Make sure that everything on your website parses correctly.</li>
   <li>Pay close attention to things like names and labels.</li>
  </ul>
wuhcag_what_to_do: |
  <ul>
   <li>Use HTML specifications for any script you author for your website.</li>
   <li>If you use a plugin or other element authored by a third party, make sure it uses valid HTML markup.</li>
  </ul>
