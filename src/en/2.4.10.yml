    wuhcag_detail: |
      <p>Adding section headings to all content will help your users understand your website. They are useful for users who have difficulty focusing or remembering where they are on a page, as well as users with a visual impairment, who may navigate by skipping between headings.</p>
      <p>You can help these users, and everyone else, by ensuring that all content on your website is broken up by clear and informative headings.</p>
    wuhcag_tips: |
      <ul>
       <li>The <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> define a <q>section</q> as a <q>self-contained portion of written content that deals with one or more related topics or thoughts.</q><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/navigation-mechanisms-headings.html"> See 'Understanding WCAG 2.0'</a></li>
       <li>A section may consist of one or more paragraphs and include graphics, tables, lists and sub-sections.</li>
       <li>Beware of making your content harder to read by forcing in too many headings.</li>
      </ul>
    wuhcag_what_to_do: |
      <p>Add a heading for every new thought or topic in your content (for example, a travel article may have headings to indicate the distinct sections on dining, transportation, and lodging).</p>
    wuchcag_exceptions: |
      <p>A webpage can be single block of content with only one header if it is about one thought or topic.</p>
