wuhcag_detail: |
  <p>Your users need to find their way around your website in a sequential and meaningful order. You can control this with the ‘focus order’ of your website.</p>
  <p>‘Focus order’ is the sequence in which a user accesses elements on your website. For example, some users can't use a mouse and will ‘tab’ through your website – they must access elements in an order that makes sense. This order is as simple as a bit of logic, such as going from your header to your menu to your page content.</p>
wuhcag_tips: |
  <p>If you have complied with Guideline 2.1.1, you may have already covered elements of this guideline.</p>
wuhcag_what_to_do: |
  <ul>
   <li>A well-made HTML website will often comply with this guideline.</li>
   <li>Unplug your mouse and verify that you can use the ‘Tab’ key to navigate to every part of your website and use every function, including search boxes and forms – make sure each page has a sensible focus order.</li>
  </ul>
wuchcag_exceptions: |
  <ul>
   <li>Complex items like tree diagrams do not have to be exactly programmed to a specific order, as long as your users can reach every element.</li>
   <li>You don't need to set a focus order if your page doesn't need to be navigated in a particular sequence to be understood. For example, a random collage of links or images.</li>
  </ul>
