 wuhcag_detail: |
   <p>Some of your users will have problems understanding the structure of your website. They can get lost, especially during interactions like checkouts that take place over a few pages. You can help your users by making it clear where they are on your website.</p>
   <p>This might be as simple as adding breadcrumbs and a sitemap to your website.</p>
 wuhcag_tips: |
   <ul>
    <li>Use full page titles for breadcrumbs when they are 1-3 words long (otherwise they get too long to be displayed).</li>
    <li>Abbreviate longer titles to make them easier to read (for example, ‘A Guide To Exotic Fish’ could just as well be ‘Exotic Fish’ for the purpose of a breadcrumb).</li>
    <li>For a process that takes a few pages (like a shopping cart), show all the steps in the process and highlight where the user is.</li>
    <li>If a page has a too many breadcrumbs, perhaps your website could be better organised.</li>
    <li>Use your page titles in your sitemap, organised under subheadings.</li>
   </ul>
 wuhcag_what_to_do: |
   <ul>
    <li>Use breadcrumbs to help with navigation. Show the sequence a user is following and where they are in that sequence. For example: You are here: Home > Fish > Bass; and</li>
    <li>Add a sitemap page to your website (see Guideline 2.4.5) so your users have another way of finding what they want. Add a link to the sitemap somewhere prominent like the header.</li>
   </ul>
