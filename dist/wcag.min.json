Sometimes this is quite simple, other times you have to make a judgement call on what that really means. The best bet is, as always,to be honest with your customers: what does the media convey and does your transcript do the same? Could you swap one for the other?</p>\n<p>One of the most common uses for text transcripts is when a podcast is published online. Embedding a podcast in a page is a great way of sharing your content but no good for your customers with hearing impairments. A text transcript should contain everything mentioned in the recording.</p>\n<p>Less commonly, some videos do not have sound. Your customers with visual impairments need help with this kind of content. A text transcript for a video without sound should describe what is going on in the video as clearly as possible.
