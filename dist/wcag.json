Consider the accessibility of these four examples:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>‘Use the search box’</li>\n <li>‘Use the search box on the right’</li>\n <li>‘Search by using the green rectangle box labelled ‘Search’ on the right’</li>\n <li>‘Search by using the rectangle box at the very top right of this page’</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Web designers often have an aversion to adding words, feeling that it adds to confusion.

It’s always hard to tell what the sound means and what you did do make it happen. A prime example is if you use sounds to alert users to errors on a form. The user can't tell exactly what made the error, they won't even be sure the sound indicated an error. Your users with hearing impairments have no chance.</p>\n<p>For forms, use a clear visual clue for errors and avoid sounds altogether.</p>\n<p>By making sure you don’t rely only on colour in your instructions, you can work towards Guideline 1.4.1.</p>\n",

You’re already familiar with access keys, which is why people are quick to accept them as useful. Access keys are keyboard shortcuts like ctrl +  p to print pr ctrl + s to save.</p>\n<p>Access keys work great in programs like Microsoft Word and Adobe Reader because they’re in a controlled environment. Out on the wild wild web, things aren’t so simple. Your customers access your website on a number of web browsers; some use Internet Explorer, some Firefox, some Google Chrome and so on... These web browsers have different levels of support for Access keys.</p>\n<p>Frustratingly, Access keys are a good idea for keyboard accessibility with bad implementation. If you’re a regular computer user, you probably use ctrl + p  much more often than selecting the menu with your mouse pointer.
